MicroCoded- culture slides / culture dishes
github.com/Arefvp/MicroCodes

These masks and STL files were created for cover slips or slides with a dimension of at least 24 mm by 24 mm.

To fabricate the slides use the GDSII file:
1. XOR the two layers for lift-off where MicroCodes will be indented (as seen on the paper);
2. Directly expose the MicroCodes layer for etching of the same;
3. Use the reverse of the intended for creating hard masks;
4. Use KLayout for editting the masks;
5. Feel free to reach out for questions or collaborations!
  
STL files for culture chamber and cap (As seen on the our paper) are included. 
Use 22 mm by 22 mm square cover slips to cover the gap on the cover. 
  -This ensures the transparency of the cap. 
We tested these structures using a Formlabs Form 4B printer with BioMed Clear resin as described on our paper. 
  -However there is no guarantee (including of functionality) regarling these files. 
  -Use with your own risk.
